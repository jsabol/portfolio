module.exports = "\nA small team of inspectors at USPS check the safety and maintenance of the equipment in every post office. These inspectors spend much of the year on the road, and their workdays consist of long hours taking notes, collecting data, snapping pictures, and making measurements. After that, they then spend many more hours entering the data and images into an online reporting system.\n\nThe FIT project sought to streamline this process. Through a mobile app, the inspector could collect and enter data into the system simultaneously. My role in this project was UX Designer.\n\n## User Research\n\nOur work began with a ethnographic research. We shadowed an inspector as they worked through a day. This study led to several important insights that would shape the project.\n\n* The client had originally envisioned distributing iPads to all of the inspectors, and FIT would be intended as a tablet app. However, watching the inspector climb up ladders to get to the roof, navigate through crowded basements and behind equipment, it became immediately apparent that iPads would be too big and unwieldly for the kind of work they do. Our focus shifted to designing for mobile phones first.\n* We learned that many post offices do not have wifi, so the app needed to work seamlessly offline.\n\n![User types](/img/fit/user-table.png)\n\n## Wireframes\n\n![Wireframe sample](/img/fit/wireframes-phone.jpg)\n\n\n## Style Tiles\n\n![Style tile light theme](/img/fit/styletile_light.png)\n![Style tile dark theme](/img/fit/styletile_dark.png)\n\n## Results\n\nMy detailed wireframes and user research helped define the requirements of the project, allowed the client to secure further funding, and a development team was able to begin work on the project."
