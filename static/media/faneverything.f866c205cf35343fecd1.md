module.exports = "\n*This project was completed in 2015 as part of a [Certificate in User Experience Design](http://nyusps.basno.com/9i18524o) from NYU SCPS.*\n\n## Readers want great stories\n\nFanfiction is original stories that use the setting, characters, or situations from a TV show, book, movie, or any other work.\n\nI conducted [a survey](https://shesjulie.typeform.com/to/iPH5Ba) which included 69 fanfiction readers. Survey takers were asked about what happens, before, during, and after they read fanfiction.\n\nThe survey produced four major discoveries: \n\n1. Over half of potential users are on mobile devices.\n2. Many users are reading in the evening or in bed. \n3. Writing quality is a major pain point.\n4. The vast majority of people are using sorting and filtering features to find fanfiction.\n\n![](/img/faneverything/animated-stickies-slow.gif)\n\nI also analyzed all 69 responses to key questions in a spreadsheet analysis, to get a thorough understanding of the issues users had with the apps and sites they were currently using. The top issues were **sorting and filtering** problems, **quality of writing, not enough content,** and **saving preferences** between visits.\n\n\n<div class=\"center\"><iframe width=\"705\" height=\"371\" seamless=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Yr4AblNTbXm3NeZ3kKSWD7YAq4swIlECltTPkittnsg/pubchart?oid=335859961&format=interactive\"></iframe></div>\n\n## Usability testing\n\n\nI tested my prototype with 3 participants, 1 of which whom were already familiar with the project.\n\n\n<div class=\"center\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Abq5RozkSNk\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\n\nTop Findings:\n\n- **3 out of 3** people didn’t understand the number counts beneath the “not interested” and “bookmark” buttons. \n- **2 out of 3** people got lost after using the filter buttons within the story itself, being unable to find a back or menu button.\n- **2 out of 3** people thought the filter buttons on the story page would start a new search, rather than add the filter to the current search.\n\n\n## Final prototype\n\n> “This is perfect - this is exactly what I look for.” - Test Participant 3\n\n<div class=\"center\"><iframe width=\"438\" height=\"930\" src=\"//invis.io/64NU53X87DS\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>"
